Change 2: US Language File

File Driectory "assets\minecraft\lang"

In the language files it is possible to change the color of text by appending § plus a color code to the name. 
For example chaning line 4117 to "itemGroup.buildingBlocks": "§fBuilding Blocks" makes Building Blocks title in the inventory white oppsed to the default grey.
I have changee the invenotry text colors to white so they are legible agasint the wood-grain texture of Chroma Hills inventory. ("Operator Utlities" text was changed to Orange)
