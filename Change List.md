Change 2: US Language File
File Driectory "assets\minecraft\lang"
In the file it is possible to cahnge the color of text by appending § plus a color code to the name. 
For example chaning line 4117 to "itemGroup.buildingBlocks": "§fBuilding Blocks" makes Building Blocks title in the inventory white oppsed to the default grey.
I have gone through and chanded many invenotry test colors to white so they are legible agasint the wood-grain texture of Chroma Hills inventory.
