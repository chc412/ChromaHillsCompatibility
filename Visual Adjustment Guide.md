The following are various visual bugs or perosnal preference items that do not signifigantly affect gameplay. 
Due to the licence, I will not be uploading my personal texture changes, but I will describe them if anyone wants to make the adjustments themselves for their own personal use.

Change 1: Font

Directory: assets\minecraft\font\

The chroma hills font is fun, but I found it too difficult to read ingame on signs and books. 
I replaced the files in the Font folder with a less stylized font I found from another HD texture pack.

Change 2: Dyed Armor (Leather and horse)

Directory: assets\minecraft\textures\models\armor\

Directory: assets\minecraft\textures\entity\horse\armor\

The color of dyed leather armor is, in my opinion, very dark and undersaturated. 
To brightened it up, I opened the texture files in a photo editor and adjusted the bightness and contrast to make them a bit brighter without losing too much detail

Change 3: Banenr Icons (and sheilds with banners)

Directory: \assets\minecraft\textures\entity\banner\

Directory: \assets\minecraft\textures\entity\shield\

Chroma Hills complely changes the texture for mojang.png. They changed the mojang logo to their own CH logo. 
This change breaks banner designs made by players with out the pack. I found an HD banner icon set that was faithful to the default minecraft design.

Change 4: Paintings

Directory: \assets\minecraft\textures\painting\

At somepoint Minecraft stoped supporting paintings with transparnacy. 

Many of ChromaHills paintings depended on transparent backgrounds, such as the map or untentials, now have an solid color filling in the transparent space.
I replaced the paintings with ones from different packs.

Change 5: Smooth Stone Slab

Directory: assets\minecraft\textures\block\smooth_stone_slab.png

Directory: assets\minecraft\textures\block\smooth_stone_slab_side.png

The Smooth Stone Slab does not look like it's whole block counterpart, Smooth Stone. This makes useing the block and slab varients together not work like the rest of the slab blocks.
To fix this I copied the texture from Smooth Stone over the textures for the slab and slab side.

Change 5: Book & Quill GUI Page Arrows

Directory: assets\minecraft\textures\gui\book.png

I disliked the page change arrows, black by default and the light-parchment color when highlighted.
I changed the default color to be the parchment color and the hightlight color to blue, matching the blue from the ribbon on the main book texture.
