# ChromaHillsCompatibility
Compability and bug fixes for the Minecraft Chroma Hills Texture Pack.

Chroma Hills is a recource pack created by Syclone Studios LLC. It last full update was April 12 2022.
Between April 2022 and Jan 6 2024 there have been multiple promises of updates that have not arrived as of Feb 26 2025. If there is an offical ChromaHills update, this github will be taken down.

The goal of this project is to respect the orginal license as best as possible while keeping the pack updated to the latest release version of minecraft. It will not be a dump of all files, but instead only host files that need to be replaced in the resource pack for compatibility. The latest official version is avalible on https://chromahills.com/ 
Only if the offical download becomes no longer avaliable will the whole pack be uploaded for archival purposes.

No new textures will be added, for new content you must use default textures or load a different resource pack along side Chroma Hills.

Please see the file "CH Legal PLEASE READ.txt" for the license is distribuited with the recource pack;
TLDR: Don't modify, port or redistribute.
It refrences the existance of full license, but I have not found that posted on their website.

To respect the license, texture files will be not edited unless they pose a signifiant visual bug, such as the creative inventory which was changed in minecraft version 1.19.3.
The textures will not be modified in a way that changes the art; in the case of the creative inventory, the tabs textures were simply duplicated and re-alligned to match the new inventory layout.

The main file that will be need to be updated is the pack.mcmeta file. In most case updating the the pack format number will be sufficant to load the texture pack into later version of the game. The pack format number has increased signfigantly sience release version 1.19. Release version 1.21 is pack format 34. The github will not host a new version for every minecraft version, instead a guide on how to update the number is provided, although some may prefer to find a video tutorial online "How to update recource pack" is a helpful search term.
