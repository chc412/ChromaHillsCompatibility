How to update pack.mceta

The file when opened from chromahills recource pack looks like this;

{

  "pack": {

    "pack_format": 9,

    "description": "RPG with a cartoon twist!"

  }

}

You need to change the Pack_format number to match the version of minecraft you want to play. A chart can be found at https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format
Make sure you look at Recource Pack table, not the Data Pack table.
For minecraft version 1.21, the pack format will be 34

A diologe box will appear, select a location, or leave it at default, and press the Extract button.
You will now have a regular folder that you can edit and replace files in.

Select all of these files, right click them and hover over the "send to" option, and select "Compressed (Zipped) Folder". (On windows 11, you will have to click "Show more Options" first)
